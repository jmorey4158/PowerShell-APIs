# PowerShell-APIs
C# -- PowerShell APIs for Centralized Validation. Used in publishing my #1 Selling Amazon Book.

##What Is This?
This Reposittory contains the Visual Studio 2013 Solution and Files that I used in atuhoring my best-selling Amazon Book about using centralized validation in PowerShell APIs (cmdlet code).

##Why Did I do This?
In my travels, I have been through enough PowerShell API code to know that parameter validation can be messy. And many companies that develop PowerShell cmdlets for their products didn't have standardized ways of doing this. 

SO, I had an idea (what a dangerous thing that can be, eh?) I thought to myself, "Myself, what if we could centralize all of that validation code and use Attributes on the parameter declarations in the cmdlet code tha would call that cetralized parameter validation code?"

Wel, Myself thatought that was a good enough idea to burn through some of my "spare time" to do this. I wrote all the code in C# and generated a bunch of PowerShell scripts to validate my ideas. 

The results? 

I verified that not only does centralized validtion code free up vast numbers of developer hours (not haveing to repeat validation in their code, but that centralized validation was very fast. Much faster than custom validation code flung around in cmdlet code.

I wrote up my findings in a Kindle book on Amazon and it hit #1 in its category. 

##Purpose of This Repository
I wanted people to see my work and perhaps spark some ideas...

So, enjoy the code!
